# <center>About</center>

[Vide](https://github.com/Nico-Mayer/vide) is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) + [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) starter template made by [@nico-mayer](https://github.com/Nico-Mayer).

The Goal was to create a super lightweight Vite Starter template with as few dependencies as possible, but at the same time provide a good amount of utility. To deliver a clean entry point for newcomers and advanced Vue + Vite users.

```javascript
// syntax highlighting example
const vide = () => {
  const count = 0
  const text = "Count is: "
  while (count < 100) {
    console.log(text + count)
    count++
  }
}
```
